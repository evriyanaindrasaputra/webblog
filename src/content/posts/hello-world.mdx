# Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, **Context Engineering** has emerged as a critical skill for developers and prompt engineers alike. It goes beyond simple prompt crafting; it's about architecting the information flow to the model to maximize relevance, accuracy, and performance.

```typescript
function injectContext(prompt: string, context: string[]) {
  return `Context:\n${context.join('\n')}\n\nTask: ${prompt}`;
}
```

## Why Context Matters

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini have fixed context windows. While these windows are growing (1M+ tokens), effectively utilizing this space is key.

- **Relevance**: garbage in, garbage out.
- **Cost**: More tokens = higher cost.
- **Latency**: Large context takes longer to process.

## Strategies

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

Instead of stuffing the entire documentation into the prompt, use embeddings to retrieve only the relevant chunks.

## Conclusion

Mastering context engineering allows you to build more robust AI applications that feel "smart" and aware of the user's specific situation.
